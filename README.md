Solution to 8-Queens Problem

MATLAB
Create your own function nqueens(x,n) on MATLAB where x is a vector representing positions of queens on a chessboard. The ith element of x corresponds to the column number of the queen in the ith row. n represents the number of queens. nqueens(x,n) must return the number of queens on an n x n chessboard (with n queens on it) that cannot be eaten if they are arranged in the positions specified in x. After you create this function & store it in the same directory as 8queens.m, run 8queens.m to obtain a solution to the 8-queens problem in the form of a position vector.
